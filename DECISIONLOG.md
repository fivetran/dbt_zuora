## Track Zuora transactions utilizing the `zuora__biling_history` and `zuora__revenue_line_item_history` models
To track Zuora transactions and various charges, it was determined there are two levels that will be most helpful to the end user
* Pulling Zuora data at the invoice level to understand the history of invoice, payments, taxes, discounts, and credit balance adjustments. That information can be found in the `zuora__billing_history` model. 
* Pulling Zuora data at the invoice item level to associate these transaction types with various products, rate plans, and rate plan charges. This information can be found in the `zuora__line_item_history` model. 

## Customize Zuora MRR calculations at either the account and charge level with the `zuora__monthly_recurring_revenue` and `zuora__line_item_history` models 
Zuora customers can utilize the `zuora__monthly_recurring_revenue` model to make MRR calculations at the account level. If Zuora customers would like to dig deeper, they can utilize the `zuora__line_item_history` model using `invoice_item_id` as the lowest grain and then aggregating by various charge fields. They'll have `gross_revenue`, `discount_revenue`, `net_revenue` measures available to them for finding MRR at the charge level. We also have `mrr_expected_current_month` and `mrr_expected_home_currency_current_month` fields from `rate_plan_charge` that are expected MRR values but might not necessarily be the actual MRR billed out, so it's brought in for comparison.

## Use `zuora__account_churn_analysis` in our analysis folder to examine churn at the monthly level
Customers can evaluate churn at numerous levels. In Zuora, [the general glossary evaluation of churn is at the account level](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Analytics/Analytics_Quick_Reference/Analytics_metric_glossary) and examining whether rate plan charges recur at the monthly level. We evaluate churn in the `zuora__account_churn_analysis` model in the analysis folder using this method, where you can utilize this compiled code to calculate churn more effectively.

To slice general churn by various grains like subscription, rate plan charges, products, utilize the `zuora__line_item_history` and `zuora__subscription_overview` models to gather the needed information to calculate churn. You can use charge date values to compile the necessary billing periods.
